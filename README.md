# Personality Matching Model using Machine Learning 

This app allows users to select a character and find another character who closely matches them based on certain attributes. I also use an API to fetch character images to enhance the visual appeal of our app.

For this project, weâ€™ll use a dataset containing various attributes of Game of Thrones characters. Additionally, I use the ThronesAPI to fetch images of the characters.
